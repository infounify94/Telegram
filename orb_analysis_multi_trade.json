  "trading_rules": [
    "Rule 1: Only strong breakout candles (60%+ body, volume surge, ATR expansion)",
    "Rule 2: Avoid resistance/support traps (25%+ distance from PDH/PDL)",
    "Rule 3: Trade fresh moves only (within 90 min of ORB)",
    "Rule 4: No overtrading (15%+ minimum between entries)",
    "Rule 5: Respect open location bias for better probability",
    "Rule 6: ITM strikes only (better delta, less theta decay)",
    "Rule 7: VIX < 20, adequate ORB range required",
    "Rule 8: No new trades after 12:30 PM",
    "Rule 9: Premium targets: +30% target, -35% stop",
    "Rule 10: Force exit all positions by 3:15 PM"

  "critical_notes": [
    "This is a PREMIUM EXPANSION strategy, not spot breakout",
    "Filters reduce signals from 20-30 to 4-10 per day - this is GOOD",
    "Every signal is high-probability, not random noise",
    "ITM strikes have better delta and less theta decay",
    "Paper trade for 2 weeks minimum before going live"
